    A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product or process. The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design. In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity. The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints, may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations, and is expected to interact with a certain environment. Major examples of designs include architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams, and sewing patterns.

<section>
    The person who produces a design is called a designer, which is a term generally used for people
     who work professionally in one of the various design areas—usually specifying which area is being dealt
    with (such as a textile designer, fashion designer, product designer, concept designer, web designer or 
    interior designer), but also others such as architects and engineers. A designer's sequence of activities 
    is called a design process, possibly using design methods. The process of creating a design can be brief 
    (a quick sketch) or lengthy and complicated, involving considerable research, negotiation, reflection, modeling, 
    interactive adjustment and re-design.

<h2 class="the-medium">The rational model</h2>
The rational model was independently developed by Herbert A. Simon,[7][8] an American scientist, and Gerhard Pahl and Wolfgang Beitz, two German engineering design theorists.[9] It posits that:
<ul>
    <li>Designers attempt to optimize a design candidate for known constraints and objectives.</li>
    <li>The design process is plan-driven.</li>
    <li>The design process is understood in terms of a discrete sequence of stages.</li>
</ul>
The rational model is based on a rationalist philosophy[3] and underlies the waterfall model,[10] systems development life cycle,[11] and much of the engineering design literature.[12] According to the rationalist philosophy, design is informed by research and knowledge in a predictable and controlled manner.

<h1 id="sixth-header">	Philosophies of design<a name="philosophies-of-design"></a></h2>
<section>
    Philosophy of design is the study of definitions of design, and the assumptions, foundations, and implications of design. There are also countless informal or personal philosophies for guiding design as design values and its accompanying aspects within modern design vary, both between different schools of thought[which?] and among practicing designers.[21] Design philosophies are usually for determining design goals. In this sense, design philosophies are fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a designer approaches his/her practice. Reflections on material culture and environmental concerns (sustainable design) can guide a design philosophy. An example is the First Things First manifesto which was launched within the graphic design community and states "We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication – a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design."[22]

    Today, the term design is generally used for what was formerly called the applied arts. The new term, for a very old thing, was perhaps initiated by Raymond Loewy and teachings at the Bauhaus and Ulm School of Design (HfG Ulm) in Germany during the 20th century.

    The boundaries between art and design are blurred, largely due to a range of applications both for the term 'art' and the term 'design'. Applied arts can include industrial design, graphic design, fashion design, and the decorative arts which traditionally includes craft objects. In graphic arts (2D image making that ranges from photography to illustration), the distinction is often made between fine art and commercial art, based on the context within which the work is produced and how it is traded.
    
    To a degree, some methods for creating work, such as employing intuition, are shared across the disciplines within the applied arts and fine art. Mark Getlein, writer, suggests the principles of design are "almost instinctive", "built-in", "natural", and part of "our sense of 'rightness'."[24] However, the intended application and context of the resulting works will vary greatly.
